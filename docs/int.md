The `int` type for the `main()` function is the **standard** and **recommended** return type in C. You should always use `int` for `main()` because it allows your program to communicate with the operating system (OS) or the calling environment by returning an **exit status**.

### Key Points:
- **`int main(void)`** or **`int main(int argc, char *argv[])`** should be used as the standard signatures.
- The `int` return type is essential because it allows your program to return an **exit status** to the OS. A return value of `0` signifies successful execution, while a non-zero value indicates an error or abnormal termination.

### What About `void main()`?

- **`void main()`** is **not standard** and should be avoided.
  - Some older compilers may allow `void main()`, but this is not compliant with the **C standard (ISO/IEC 9899)**.
  - Using `void main()` may work in specific environments, but it prevents the program from returning a status code, making it unreliable for general use.

### Why Is `int` Important?

1. **Communicates with the Operating System:**
   - The **return value of `main()`** is passed back to the OS, which uses it to determine if the program finished successfully or encountered an error.
   - Returning `0` tells the OS that the program completed successfully, while any non-zero return value signals an error.

2. **Exit Status in Scripts or Other Programs:**
   - If your program is called by a script or another program, that program can check the exit status to see if it ran correctly.
   - For example, in Unix/Linux, you can check the exit status of a program using `$?` in the shell.

   Example:
   ```bash
   ./my_program
   if [ $? -eq 0 ]; then
       echo "Program succeeded"
   else
       echo "Program failed"
   fi
   ```

3. **Code Portability:**
   - Using `int main()` ensures that your code is **portable** and **compliant** across different platforms and compilers. It follows the official C standard, making your code compatible in different environments.

### Example:

```c
#include <stdio.h>

int main(void)  // Use int here for a proper return type
{
    printf("Hello, World!\n");
    return 0;  // Return 0 to indicate successful execution
}
```

This is the proper way to define `main()`.

### Avoiding `void main()`:

```c
void main(void)  // Incorrect and non-standard
{
    printf("Hello, World!\n");
    // No return statement, which is problematic
}
```

While this might compile on some compilers, it's not recommended or portable. Avoid this pattern to follow best practices.

### Summary:
- **Always use `int`** as the return type of `main()`.
- **Return a value** (usually `return 0;` for success) to communicate the exit status to the OS.
- Avoid `void main()`, as it is non-standard and can lead to unpredictable behavior or portability issues.

Using `int main()` is a best practice that will ensure your programs are reliable, portable, and compliant with the C standard. Let me know if you have any other questions!
